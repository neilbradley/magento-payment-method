# Magento Payment Method
This is a simple Custom Payment Method for Magento. It provides a new Payment Method for processing orders named "No Payment Taken Through Website".

Created for a client, this was primarily used for creating Admin Orders and includes a Payment Description field.

The custom payment method also automatically creates an invoice - which overrides default Magento behaviour that does not create an invoice when a card hasn't been processed.

**Note:** This has only been tested on Magento 1.9.0.1.
